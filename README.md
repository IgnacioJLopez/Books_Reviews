# Goodreads Book Review Rating Prediction

This repository contains multiple scripts used to solve the challenge of predicting the rating of book reviews scraped from the Goodreads website.
This project was developed to tackle a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/goodreads-books-reviews-290312)


<h2>Challenge Description</h2>

The dataset provided consists of book reviews from the Goodreads website, along with various attributes describing the items. The objective of the challenge is to predict the rating of the reviews, which range from 0 to 5.



<h2>Solution</h2>

The provided dataset is preprocessed using data cleaning techniques such as removing punctuation, stop words, and stemming. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed on the dataset to understand the patterns and correlations between different features.

The machine learning models used for the prediction are based on Sklearn, TensorFlow, Naive Bayes, and NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization). Natural Language Processing techniques are used to extract features from the text data.


<h2>Requirements</h2>

The scripts in this repository require the following libraries to be installed:

- Sklearn
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Matplotlib

<h2>Conclision</h2>

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for the Goodreads Book Review Rating Prediction challenge. The different scripts can be used to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and prediction using machine learning models.
